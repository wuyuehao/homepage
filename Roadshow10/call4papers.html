The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is proud to announce that Apache Asia Roadshow 2010 will be held in <font color=red>Shanghai, China, in Aug. 14th-15th, 2010</font>.
</p>
<p class="conf2">
Apache <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/apachecon/RoadShow" target="_blank">RoadShow</a> is a global event of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Apache Software Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1999. It operates the Apache open source community, one of the largest and most successful of its kind in the world. Its projects are mostly related to enterprise computing, especially in the Web application and Java platform area. The ASF produces many popular software projects for developers and enterprises, including Apache HTTP Server, Subversion version control system, Harmony Java runtime, Tomcat Web Container, Geronimo Java EE application server, Struts Web framework, Derby database and many others. 
</p>
<p class="conf2">
Each year, Apache Software Foundation hosts events around the world to facilitate discussions on the evolvement of open source movement and to present the latest Apache products and technology. These events provide a platform for open source developers and users to meet and communicate, and are regarded as first-class open source events. Apache Asia Roadshow is the name of this year's Apache event in Asia. Last year's event took place in Beijing, attended by ASF president Justin Erenkrantz, ASF director and Subversion co-founder Greg Stein, and China OSS Promotion Union president Lu Shou Qun. Participants include people from Intel, IBM, Google, ASF, Mozilla and Eclipse community and others. Click <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/apachecon/ApacheRoadshowAsia09Beijing" target="_blank">here</a> for more details. 
</p>
<p class="conf2">
The topic of this year's event is open source and emerging technology, directed at software developers, university students and anyone that loves open source. The goal is to provide an opportunity for showcase and communication, and to help people understand what's going on in ASF and other open source communities. It will be a gathering of developers, users and companies, talking about technologies, sharing experiences and best practices, exchanging ideas, and making friends!
